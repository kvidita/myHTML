        Whales are a widely distributed and diverse group of fully aquatic placental marine mammals. As an informal and
        colloquial grouping, they correspond to large members of the infraorder Cetacea, i.e. all cetaceans apart from
        dolphins
        and porpoises. Dolphins and porpoises may be considered whales from a formal, cladistic perspective. Whales,
        dolphins
        and porpoises belong to the order Cetartiodactyla, which consists of even-toed ungulates. Their closest
        non-cetacean
        living relatives are the hippopotamuses, from which they and other cetaceans diverged about 54 million years
        ago. The
        two parvorders of whales, baleen whales (Mysticeti) and toothed whales (Odontoceti), are thought to have had
        their last
        common ancestor around 34 million years ago. Mysticetes include four extant (living) families: Balaenopteridae
        (the
        rorquals), Balaenidae (right whales), Cetotheriidae (the pygmy right whale), and Eschrichtiidae (the grey
        whale).
        Odontocetes include the Monodontidae (belugas and narwhals), Physeteridae (the sperm whale), Kogiidae (the dwarf
        and
        pygmy sperm whale), and Ziphiidae (the beaked whales), as well as the six families of dolphins and porpoises
        which are
        not considered whales in the informal sense.

        Whales are fully aquatic, open-ocean animals: they can feed, mate, give birth, suckle and raise their young at
        sea.
        Whales range in size from the 2.6 metres (8.5 ft) and 135 kilograms (298 lb) dwarf sperm whale to the 29.9
        metres (98
        ft) and 190 tonnes (210 short tons) blue whale, which is the largest known animal that has ever lived. The sperm
        whale
        is the largest toothed predator on Earth. Several whale species exhibit sexual dimorphism, in that the females
        are
        larger than males.

        Baleen whales have no teeth; instead, they have plates of baleen, fringe-like structures that enable them to
        expel the
        huge mouthfuls of water they take in while retaining the krill and plankton they feed on. Because their heads
        are
        enormous—making up as much as 40% of their total body mass—and they have throat pleats that enable them to
        expand their
        mouths, they are able to take huge quantities of water into their mouth at a time. Baleen whales also have a
        well-developed sense of smell.
